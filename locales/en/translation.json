    "info": "I am a frontend development engineer, involved in backend development work for some Node.js projects. In 2014, I started to engage in open source work during my spare time.",
    "info2": "For nearly 10 years, I have been contributing to the open source community, with close to <repo>300 code repositories</repo> and publishing over <npm>500 packages</npm> through npm. In the past year, these packages have been downloaded nearly 60 million times on npm. Currently, I am on the verge of unemployment, having received almost no donations in the open source field. Nevertheless, I continue to dedicate my time and energy to contribute. Therefore, I plan to explore a career change within 1 to 2 years, but I will still actively participate in open source sharing. To me, it has become a habit as natural as brushing my teeth every morning. Open source sharing is an integral part of my life, and I am enthusiastic about giving back my knowledge and experience to the open source community.",
