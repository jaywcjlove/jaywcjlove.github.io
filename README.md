### [About Me](https://wangchujiang.com)

I am a frontend development engineer, involved in backend development work for some Node.js projects. In 2014, I started to engage in open source work during my spare time.

For nearly 10 years, I have been contributing to the open source community, with close to [300 code repositories](https://github.com/search?q=user:jaywcjlove+user:uiwjs+user:tsbbjs+user:kktjs+user:antdpro+user:JSLite+archived:false&type=Repositories) and publishing over [500 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~wcjiang) through npm. In the past year, these packages have been downloaded nearly 60 million times on npm. Currently, I am on the verge of unemployment, having received almost no donations in the open source field. Nevertheless, I continue to dedicate my time and energy to contribute. Therefore, I plan to explore a career change within 1 to 2 years, but I will still actively participate in open source sharing. To me, it has become a habit as natural as brushing my teeth every morning. Open source sharing is an integral part of my life, and I am enthusiastic about giving back my knowledge and experience to the open source community.

I love open source and still have a passion for the work I do. Keep going!
